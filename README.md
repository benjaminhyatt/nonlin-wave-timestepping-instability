# nonlin-wave-timestepping-instability

This repository contains scripts used to generate the data and figures presented in an upcoming manuscript "Multiple scales analysis of a nonlinear timestepping instability in simulations of solitons" by Hyatt et al. Below is a description of the contents of the repository: 

## Soliton propagation initial value problems

## von Neumann analysis eigenvalue problems

## Processing scripts

## Processed data

## Plotting scripts
